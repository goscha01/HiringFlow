/**
 * Soft "are you sure?" guard surfaced in the automation editor's save flow.
 *
 * Targets a class of recruiter mistakes where the trigger and the message
 * body disagree about what event just happened — typically because the
 * recruiter cloned an old rule, edited the body, but left the trigger
 * pointing at the wrong lifecycle event. The Test George incident
 * (2026-05-11) is the seed case: a `before_meeting` reminder whose SMS
 * body told the candidate the meeting had been rescheduled, so every
 * candidate received a "rescheduled" SMS 5 min before every interview.
 *
 * These warnings are advisory, not blocking. The editor renders them
 * inline and the user can choose Save anyway — there are legitimate
 * cases the heuristics will false-positive on (e.g. a `before_meeting`
 * rule whose body discusses an earlier reschedule by design).
 *
 * Pattern matching is purely lexical against the SMS body and email
 * template subject. We don't fetch email template bodies here because
 * the editor doesn't have them on the client; covering subjects catches
 * the most common slip (cloned rules keep the old subject line).
